# ⚠️ NOTE: package-lock.json

This file will be automatically generated when you run:

```bash
npm install
```

**DO NOT create this file manually.**

It contains the exact dependency tree and is auto-generated by npm.

---

## To generate package-lock.json:

```bash
cd backend/functions
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies from `package.json` and create `package-lock.json` and `node_modules/` folder.

---

## What gets installed:

- `firebase-admin@^12.0.0`
- `firebase-functions@^4.5.0`
- `openai@^4.24.1`
- All their transitive dependencies

---

**After running `npm install`, you will have:**

```
functions/
├── package.json          (already exists)
├── package-lock.json     (auto-generated)
├── node_modules/         (auto-generated)
